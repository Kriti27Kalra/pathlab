										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Doctors perform KUB ultrasound as a simple painless procedure that enables them to inspect the kidneys together with ureters and bladder. Sound waves function similarly during KUB ultrasound scans because healthcare providers can develop urinary system disorder diagnoses through image data. Patients receive diagnoses for bladder stones kidney tumors and other kidney conditions through KUB ultrasound exams performed by their physicians. This paper examines KUB ultrasound as a diagnostic tool by explaining its definition along with its operational method and its essential role in medical procedures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a KUB Ultrasound?</h2>



<p>KUB ultrasound functions as a particular imaging test that targets the evaluation of the kidney along with the ureter and the bladder region. The procedure bounces sound waves within body organs before exhibiting pictures live on a monitor. The ultrasound procedure offers safety benefits to children and those who are pregnant since it avoids radiation exposure which CT scan and MRI technology employs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is the USG PUB Test Used For?</h2>



<p>The USG PUB test can be very useful in identifying the problems present in the urinary system. The commonly utilized KUB ultrasound tests include the following conditions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The KUB ultrasound mainly serves to evaluate kidney stones which represent a frequent reason for this diagnostic procedure. Ultrasound testing enables healthcare providers to measure kidney and ureteral stones regarding dimensions and quantity and precise location by number.</li>



<li>The presence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) typically leads to either intense pain alongside frequent urinary urges. An ultrasound imaging test evaluates most complications which include swelling of kidneys and bladder.</li>



<li>A KUB ultrasound provides the ability to identify both bladder enlargement and bladder stones and tumors.</li>



<li>When an ultrasound patient performs the test they can search for urinary tract blockages that prevent kidney urine from reaching the bladder.</li>



<li>The KUB ultrasound evaluates growth alterations in kidneys and bladder tissue by finding cysts and tumors.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does KUB Ultrasound Show?</h2>



<p>KUB ultrasound creates visible scans that show both regular and irregular structures of the kidneys ureters and bladder. The ultrasound can show:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An ultrasound examination reveals three critical items relating to kidney condition. This includes proper kidney size along with accurate measurement of kidney shape and correct positioning. The equipment can identify the presence of cysts or kidney stones within the body.</li>



<li>An ultrasound offers good indications regarding abnormal conditions when ureters show blockage or narrowing and impede urine flow.</li>



<li>The examination shows signs of bladder stones together with enlarged bladder and irregular bladder mass which could indicate tumor formation.</li>



<li>Through urinary retention tests, medical professionals determine complete bladder drainage and the amount of urine left after patients empty their bladders.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Prepare for a KUB Ultrasound Scan?</h2>



<p>People who need KUB ultrasound tests only need to follow basic preparation steps. Patients usually encounter these standard procedures before their KUB ultrasound test:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Medical staff will provide prescribed water consumption through multiple glass offerings as part of testing preparation before the examination day. A full bladder is required for obtaining clear images of both kidneys and bladder during ultrasound examination.</li>



<li>Doctors sometimes instruct their patients to avoid both eating and drinking during a specific period before the examination if kidney examination takes priority.</li>



<li>Wear clothing that provides easy access to your stomach because technicians need to apply gel to the examination site.</li>



<li>Inform your health provider about all drugs you take because they can impact your urinary system. Shadowing these instructions will enable doctors to better understand test results.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the procedure for Ultrasound PUB?</h2>



<p>KUB ultrasound examination takes only a short amount while causing no discomfort to patients. This is how it usually goes:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The technician will instruct you to place your body on your back while lying on the examination table. The procedure requires the patient to shift positions occasionally to improve imaging results.</li>



<li>The technician will apply a gel to your pelvic region or your abdomen area. The ultrasound probe achieves better image clarity by using this gel which enhances its skin contact.</li>



<li>The device known as a transducer performs both emitting and recording sound waves. The physician uses a gentle scanning motion to let the device create imaging of the kidneys and ureters together with the bladder.</li>



<li>The technician will obtain multiple pictures by using different camera positions. Better pictures can be obtained through breath-holding or changing your body position at the request of the technician.</li>



<li>A kidney stone ultrasound requires 20 to 30 minutes to complete based on scan difficulty.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to Expect After a KUB Ultrasound?</h2>



<p>You have the freedom to continue as you normally would right after finishing the test. Different ultrasound images collected from the procedure will be referred to radiologists or consultants for interpretation. The diagnostic results undergo analysis by your doctor who uses this information to explain everything to you. Your physician will convey the test results followed by instructions for necessary supplementary tests and procedures.</p>



<p>The doctor will make decisions about necessary treatment after examining ultrasound results. In case no concerning results appear the doctor might decide to adopt only a surveillance approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of KUB Ultrasound</h2>



<p>KUB ultrasound provides several benefits for diagnosing urinary system disorders because it maintains such advantages:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The KUB ultrasound examination operates without invasive procedures so patients avoid the need for needles or surgery or receiving any injections.</li>



<li>The test method poses no radiation risk to patients because of its safety thus it remains accessible for all people without limitations.</li>



<li>A KUB ultrasound provides quick examination results without causing any discomfort to patients.</li>



<li>A KUB ultrasound costs less than other imaging exams while providing a cost-effective diagnostic solution.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> If someone tells you to check your pulse, they are most probably asking you the rate a heart is beating. Now to the question, are the heart rate and pulse are same? The short answer is: not entirely. Although monitoring pulse rate is almost equal to monitoring heart rate, especially for those who are in optimum health, there is a slight difference in their meaning and how they are measured.</p>



<p>Most importantly people should learn more about their bodies with all the complications that come with it. Several signs are used to determine cardiovascular health and two of them are heart rate and pulse rate. Although they are often used interchangeably there are some slight differences between them. Here in the blog, let’s delve into the difference between heart rate and pulse rate, how it could be measured, and what are the recommended ranges for a healthy heart rate and pulse rate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Heart Rate?</h2>



<p>Heart rate is the number of contractions of the heart muscle per minute or simply beats per one minute. This is a measure of the heart directly, which gives valuable information about how effectively your heart and circulatory system is working.</p>



<p>The human body has monitoring mechanisms that control the heartbeat enhancing flexibility depending on the activities and circumstances of the body. The heartbeat increases when a person is angry and decreases when the person is at rest. It is not safe for a person to go beyond 95% of the maximum heart rate level of excitement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the Normal Range of Heart Rate?</h2>



<p>A resting adult has a heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute and the number may be higher or lower depending on fitness level, age, and other conditions. Athletes and persons having extremely low levels of body fat usually record resting heart rate of less than 60 BPM or beats per minute.</p>



<p>So let’s consider the heart rate in relation to age, here are the most valuable pieces of information that will change your idea of ​​the heartbeat normal range which is not a dangerous heart rate at all.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For infants it is approximately 70-190 bpm.</li>



<li>In children aged between 3 to 9 years, it is between 70 to 130 bpm</li>



<li>In teenagers, from the age of ten to twenty years, it ranges between 60 – 100 beats per minute.</li>



<li>It is higher with the above 20 years group but it stays almost constant without any fluctuation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>What are the Methods of Measuring Heart Rate?</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Manual Palpation &#8211; Take the two fingers (index and middle) and place it on the side of the wrist or the neck. Take the beats for 15 seconds and then multiply that number by 4.</li>



<li>Heart Rate Monitors &#8211; Smart accessories such as smartwatches.</li>



<li>Electrocardiogram (ECG) &#8211; A medical test that can give an accurate readout of the heart’s performance during an exam.</li>



<li>Pulse Oximeter &#8211; Measures oxygen levels and pulse using sensors that are attached to fingertips.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>What is Pulse Rate?</h2>



<p>Pulse rate is defined as the count of the palpitation felt in a sixty seconds period. These pulses are actually caused by the regular throbbing motion of the arteries as a result of blood flow, beat of the heart. The pulse rate thus gives the heart rate most of the time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>What is the Normal Range of Pulse Rate?</h2>



<p>Just like the heart rate, the pulse rate in adults ranges from 60 to 100 with the average being 72 beats per minute. However, stress, temperature, or any intense physical activity may cause the rate to increase or decrease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>What are the Methods of Measuring Pulse Rate?</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Radial Pulse &#8211; Take the position where you put the fingers at the level of the wrist close to the base of the thumb.</li>



<li>Carotid Pulse &#8211; Position your hands on the side of the neck just below where your jaw line is.</li>



<li>Other Pulse Points &#8211; Pulse can also be present in regions such as the brachial, femoral, and dorsalis pedis arteries.</li>



<li>Pulse Rate Monitors &#8211; Some specific devices to use include pulse oximeters or even fitness trackers.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Heart Rate and Pulse Rate Difference</h2>



<p>The heart is one of the greatest wonders of nature; it beats away ceaselessly performing the function of circulation. Its rhythm is often measured using two terms: heartbeat vs pulse rate. These metrics provide information on the cardiovascular well-being of an individual. But are they the same? Well, if they are not the same, how are they different? Let’s dive into the concept which distinguishes pulse rate from heart rate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Aspect</strong></td><td><strong>Heart rate</strong></td><td><strong>Pulse rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Definition</td><td>Regularity of the heartbeat per minute.</td><td>Palpable number of heartbeats per minute.</td></tr><tr><td>Measurement location</td><td>Internal measurement, like through ECG.</td><td>Assessed in terms of external circulation, that is at pulse points.</td></tr><tr><td>Measurement tools</td><td>Smartwatches, fitness trackers, and electrocardiographs.</td><td>Pulse oximeters and manual palpation.</td></tr><tr><td>Dependency</td><td>Independent of pulse rate.</td><td>Dependent on heart rate.</td></tr><tr><td>Accuracy</td><td>Information on cardiac activity as the total output or a single component can be obtained directly.</td><td>Indirect heart rate reflection.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Factors Affect Heart Rate and Pulse Rate</h2>



<p>As you are aware of pulse rate vs heart rate, here are some factors that influence both heart rate and pulse rate:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Physical Activity: These include that exercise raises the rate of the heartbeat and pulse. While rest time reduces them.</li>



<li>Emotional State: Rates are likely to go high due to stress, anxiety, or excitement. They can be reduced with meditation, and being calm.</li>



<li>Health Conditions: The variations may be caused by fever, dehydration, or heart conditions.</li>



<li>Age and Fitness Level: It is a fact that resting rates decrease with age and are lower in athletes in comparison to non-athletes.</li>



<li>Medications: Some medications decrease the rate such as beta blockers while others can raise the rate such as Caffeine.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Tips for Maintaining Normal Heart Rate and Pulse Rate</h2>



<p>To keep your heart rate and pulse rate within a healthy range, follow these tips:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Exercise Regularly: Do activities that are aerobic with little or no exertion; it includes walking, swimming, and cycling. Add strength activities into your fitness regime for enhanced health.</li>



<li>Practice Stress Management: Use stress minimizing methods such as doing yoga or meditating. If possible, reduce chronic stressors in your life.</li>



<li>Eat a Heart-Healthy Diet: Supplements, particularly those containing Omega 3 fatty acids, whole grain foods and lean meats should form the basis of any diet. Reduce the daily intake of salt and sugar and saturated fats.</li>



<li>Stay Hydrated: Water is important for hydration and its lack can put pressure on the heart so take a lot of water each day.</li>



<li>Avoid Harmful Habits: Avoid consuming caffeine and alcohol bearing products. Stop smoking in order to enhance the status of your cardiovascular system.</li>



<li>Get Regular Check-Ups: Special attention must be taken in checking heart rate from time to time at the <strong><a href="https://precisionpathlab.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://precisionpathlab.com/">best diagnostic center</a></strong> to check for abnormalities.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There is some difference between pulse rate and heart rate, this is due to the differences in their definitions and in the manner in which they are measured as well as the kind of information they can give. Whereas the heart rate reveals the kind of work the heart is performing internally, the pulse rate displays the work the arteries are doing on account of the internal activity of the heart.</p>



<p>Knowledge about these statistics is indispensable when it comes to keeping healthy and early identification of health problems. By adopting a healthy lifestyle, there won’t be a difference between the heartbeat procedures, promoting a healthy life. Additionally, regular health monitoring through reliable services like <strong>Precision Pathlab&#8217;s</strong> <strong><a href="https://precisionpathlab.com/full-body-check-up-in-jaipur.php" data-type="link" data-id="https://precisionpathlab.com/full-body-check-up-in-jaipur.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full body checkup in Jaipur</a></strong> can ensure early detection of potential health issues, helping you stay proactive about your health. Book the test now </p>



<p>Therefore, the next time someone has a question about “Is the heart rate and pulse are same”, you are assured of explaining the difference between pulse rate and heart rate and their uses in your fitness process.</p>

Just by identifying certain issues in glucose levels, all these tests allow healthcare professionals to design efficient treatment plans while recommending various lifestyle adjustments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;List of Blood Tests That Help Identify Diabetes</h2>



<p>Diabetes tests help monitor blood sugar levels and detect prediabetes or diabetes early. Here’s a list of essential blood tests to diagnose diabetes effectively</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test</li>



<li>Random Plasma Glucose (RPG) Test</li>



<li>Postprandial Blood Sugar Test (PPBS)</li>



<li>HbA1C Test</li>



<li>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test</h3>



<p>The best test that effectively measures blood sugar levels after a person has fasted for almost 8 hours. This test is usually used to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes. Fasting plasma glucose test includes drawing off a blood sample from a vein, usually in the morning before breakfast. And, this test is highly effective in diagnosing diabetes during early stages. Moreover, in this test blood sugar values include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Normal &#8211; Less than 100mg/dL.</li>



<li>Prediabetes &#8211; 100-125 mg/dL.</li>



<li>Diabetes &#8211; 126 mg/dL or more.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Random Plasma Glucose (RPG) Test</h3>



<p>This test effectively measures blood sugar levels at any time during the day, irrespective of when an individual last ate. In this test, a <strong><a href="https://precisionpathlab.com/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://precisionpathlab.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnostic centre</a></strong> draws blood samples without any prior fasting.

Moreover, this test properly evaluates how your body manages blood sugar just after eating and could easily detect insulin resistance. Moreover, its blood sugar values are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Normal &#8211; Less than 140 mg/dL.</li>



<li>Prediabetes &#8211; 140-199 mg/dL.</li>



<li>Diabetes &#8211; 200 mg/dL or more.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HbA1C Test</h3>



<p>Well-known as a glycated hemoglobin test, the HbA1C test properly measures average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. In this test, a blood sample is already drawn, and the test calculates the percentage of glucose combined with hemoglobin in red blood cells. And, this test monitors long-term diabetes and diagnoses the effectiveness of treatment plans. And, its blood sugar levels include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Normal &#8211; Less than 5.7%.</li>



<li>Prediabetes &#8211; Ranges between 5.7-6.4%.</li>



<li>Diabetes &#8211; 6.5% or more.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)</h3>



<p>The Oral Glucose Tolerance Test effectively evaluates your body’s ability to process glucose just after consumption of sugary beverages. And, this test includes fasting the whole night, drinking glucose solution, and measuring blood sugar levels at frequent intervals. And, this effective test is used in diagnosing gestational diabetes during pregnancy and it diagnoses glucose tolerance. And, its blood sugar levels after 2 hours of glucose drink are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Normal &#8211; Less than 140 mg/dL.</li>



<li>Prediabetes &#8211; 140-199 mg/dL.</li>

<p>Full body checkups, also known as comprehensive health screenings, involve an in-depth investigation into the state of an individual&#8217;s health and well-being on a holistic level. This evaluation will generally consist of a battery of tests, including blood pressure and cholesterol levels, the determination of body mass index (BMI) and screenings for several other disorders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>&nbsp;II. The Benefits of Regular Full Body Checkups</h3>



<p>Checkups that cover the individual&#8217;s entire body regularly give many advantages to the individual&#8217;s health and well-being in general. It gives tailored health evaluations, which provide a comprehensive picture of an individual&#8217;s current health condition and enable informed decision-making for a proactive approach to managing one&#8217;s health. Individuals can make their health a priority and take preventative measures toward living a healthier and more meaningful life if they take advantage of these examinations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>III. Frequency and Timing of Full Body Checkups</h3>



<p>Regarding preventative healthcare management, the frequency and timing of full-body checks are two of the most critical factors. The optimal frequency varies from person to person, depending on age, overall health, and risk. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that adults get a complete body checkup at least once a year. However, certain individuals with specific health concerns may need to get tests more frequently. Checkups consistently and at appropriate intervals aid in the early diagnosis of potential health problems and make it easier to take preventative action. Conversing with a healthcare professional is vital to identify the ideal timing and frequency of complete body exams. It will ensure timely monitoring and maintenance of one&#8217;s health, allowing one to live a healthier and more satisfying life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>IV. Overcoming Common Objections to Full Body Checkups</h3>



<p>Two fundamental approaches are required to prevail over the widespread resistance to full-body examinations. First, they address the myths and anxieties commonly linked with checkups, such as concerns about discomfort or tests that aren&#8217;t essential. These apprehensions might be allayed by giving them understandable answers and reassuring them. Second, it is necessary to provide counterarguments supported by data to emphasize the advantages of whole-body exams. These advantages include the early discovery of health problems and preventative healthcare. Individuals might be encouraged to place a higher priority on their health and to embrace checkups as a proactive approach to wellness if the worth of routine screenings is demonstrated to them through data and success stories. The combination of these tactics helps to develop a good image of complete body exams, ultimately leading to better healthcare outcomes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>V. Making the Most of Your Full Body Checkup</h3>



<p>Three primary actions must be taken to get the most out of your whole body checkup. To begin, you should prepare for the checkup by compiling any pertinent medical history, identifying any current medications, and noting any particular health concerns.

<p>Facing Chills and Rigors without fever is a perplexing and uneasy situation. Generally, a chill is associated with the onset of a fever or an infection. However, countless other causes exist for cold sensations or shivering without fever. Therefore, comprehending these probable causes is essential to facilitate their administration and control when necessary. This article discusses different types of chills and rigors without fever when you should consult your doctor, and what you need to know about a correct diagnosis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Causes of Chills and Rigors Without Fever</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cold Environment</h3>



<p>One of the easiest ways to develop cold and shivering is by exposure to cold. When exposed to low temperatures, the body reduces blood flow to the skin to keep warm, with chills being the eventual outcome. This reaction is the sympathetic nervous system&#8217;s effort to stabilize the core body temperature. There is also a recognizable loss of warmth, often relieved by wearing proper clothes, using blankets, or seeking heat. It is also essential to avoid going out during freezing weather or use heating equipment to prevent chills due to weather conditions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hypothyroidism</h3>



<p>Hypothyroidism is a type of medical condition under which the thyroid gland cannot generate sufficient hormone levels to allow the body to metabolize and keep a respectable temperature. Strawberry venom on hypothyroidism symptoms include but are not limited to chills and cold feelings, fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, and dry skin. This condition may also alter how the body reacts to heat or cold stress. If you have thyroid problems, it is better to talk to your doctor and get checked for possible treatment. Other treatments are hormone replacement therapy, which can control the body temperature and decrease cases of chills.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Anxiety or Panic Attacks</h3>



<p>When people experience anxiety and panic attacks, they have been known to develop chills and shivering. It is also important to note that during moments of anxiety, one&#8217;s body temperature can go up or down in what is known as the &#8220;flight or fight&#8221; response. An increased breathing rate, expected with panic attacks, can cause feelings of coldness even when the surroundings are warm. People can also have some accompanying signs, which include tachycardia, shortness of breath, or a sense that they are going to die. These physical manifestations may be helped by anxiety from therapy, medication, or practicing relaxation techniques. Prayer and meditation practices and breathing techniques can also decrease the rate of anxiety and lessen chills.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels in the body)</h3>



<p>Low blood sugar is a medical condition when the glucose level is below normal, and symptoms are cold sweat, clammy skin, shaking, and weakness. This condition mostly comes up when a diabetic person has a history of taking a lot of insulin, misses their meals, or engages in very many exercises without eating anything. Nevertheless, everyone can get hypoglycemia if s/he has not had a meal within several hours. Anytime you have chills accompanied by dizziness, irritability, confusion, and rest, taking something like juice, honey, or a glucose tablet should be a good idea. It is also good to take regular blood sugar tests and ensure one takes the correct meal that will not cause them to have hypoglycemic episodes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dehydration</h3>



<p>Prolonged loss of body water can interfere with normal thermoregulation and cause the patient to develop chills. Dehydration occurs when the body cannot produce adequate fluids and, therefore, will always be cold, however, cold. Other signs also include dry mouth, fatigue, and dark-colored urine. Drinking enough water, especially during summer, exercise, or disease, is vital to the body&#8217;s well-being. They also explain that maintaining a steady intake of fluids whole the day and avoiding dehydration by taking fruits and vegetables can assist in getting rid of the symptoms of dehydration.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Anemia</h3>



<p>A deficiency of red blood cells or lack of hemoglobin may cause anemia; the signs decrease oxygen supply to the tissues, including fatigue, weak muscles, and chills. Cold hands and feet are standard among patients who suffer from anemia because the body temperature increases. The primary forms of anemia include iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 anemia, and chronic diseases. If anemia is the issue, a blood test can show the anemia and dietary changes, and iron and B12 shots may be prescribed. Control by keeping anemia under close observation during routine checkups can be very effective.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Medications or Drug Reactions</h3>



<p>In certain cases, chills are a known side effect of certain drugs. For instance, opioids, some antidepressants, and antipsychotics that alter thermoregulation may cause shivering. Also, the chills can be because of an allergic reaction to some medications like antibiotics and antiviral which lead to rashes, breathing problems, and swelling. This is important because if you are developing chills after starting a certain medication there may be other remedies for it, or the dose may need to be altered.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sepsis (Early Stages)</h3>



<p>Sepsis may be manifested by an elevated temperature and often, rigors, which are features seen in patients with early sepsis. Sepsis is an extreme response that happens when the normal inflammatory process that occurs due to infection leads to confusion of body tissue. They may also include fever, shivering, delirium, tachycardia, oxygen decrease, and shortness of breath. If those signs combine with chills, immediate medical intervention must be sought as sepsis progresses quite quickly and can cause more harm or be fatal. It may be as mild as providing fluids, antibiotics, and supporting care. Thus, early presentation is effective in helping the patient survive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Malnutrition</h3>



<p>If a body is not providing sufficient nutrients, it can cause several health complications, including thermal regulation. Malnourished people may shiver because their bodies have no nutritional reserves and the necessary vitamins and minerals to produce energy. The typical symptoms of malnutrition include loss of weight, which is often undesired, tiredness, and weakness. Ample proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and micronutrients come under a proper diet and it is also important to mention that a proper diet is a control bar to guarantee a healthy temperature of the human body and overall health. It is possible to get advice from a nutritionist and expert to understand which meal plan suits the person.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hormonal Imbalances</h3>



<p>The temperature regulation problem is typical when a woman is in the menopausal period or may be due to adrenal gland diseases. Some women at the onset of their menopausal period may feel hot after hot flashes before going cold or have an adrenal failure, which causes them to fatten and weaken and feel the cold quickly. Sex hormones, mainly estrogen and testosterone, are known to have profound effects on thermoregulation. When hormonal changes are assumed, it can also be best to consult a healthcare provider to manage the conditions affecting the patient. This temperature regulation may improve when the patient undergoes hormonal therapies or even some lifestyle changes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hypovolemic Shock</h3>



<p>Chills resulting from hypovolemic shock may result from bleeding or loss of significant amounts of fluids in a shock state in an endeavor to maintain vital functions. Symptoms may include a fast pulse, confusion, weak muscles, and cold, damp skin. Medical help should be sought if one is suffering from severe dehydration, a significant bleeding injury, or any other health complication. This condition is a medical emergency as its treatment involves the administration of volumes needed to maintain circulation for the necessary human organs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get Tested and Consult with a Doctor</h2>



<p>Medical attention may be needed to obtain further treatment if the chills and rigors are without fever, recurring, or even if they are coupled with other symptoms. A healthcare provider should adequately assess the cause of the problem and then advise appropriately. A reliable <strong><a href="https://precisionpathlab.com/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://precisionpathlab.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnostic center</a></strong> like Precision Pathlab can assist with a blood test or an imaging study that suggests anemia, hypothyroidism, infection, or metabolic abnormality, among others. Screening programs and methods can be asserted by identifying and acting in the initial stage of a disease to control its effects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The presence of chills and rigors without a fever can have numerous causes due to the external environment to internal diseases. Being aware of specific symptoms and being able to link them to possible causes is important if the symptoms are to be dealt with appropriately. If you face this problem very often, and it seems impossible to point out any diseases that can be the root of such symptoms, you should consult a doctor. A distinction is made between early intervention, which often provides better results and improved quality of life. Preferably, focusing more on the self and body cues while facing health challenges is equally important.</p>

<p>Creatinine is thus an extra product that is generated as a by-product of the catabolism of muscle tissue. Creatinine is one of the wastes which cleared from the body by the working of the kidneys where it is filtered from the blood and then passed through the urine.</p>



<p>Creatinine is produced when the kidney is in poor health and if there is a high concentration of creatinine in blood then it means that the kidney is not healthy. It should be necessary to have good kidney and general health to understand the manifestations, factors, and management regarding high creatinine levels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Creatinine?</h2>



<p>Creatinine is the result of the metabolism of creatine this being a component of muscles that is subject to catabolism. Creatine is used for supplying energy to muscles and during this process, creatinine is produced. At other times, through the urinal system, creatinine is removed from the blood through the kidneys.</p>



<p>The Creatinine blood test is one of those tests that are used in the assessment of renal health. It is believed that relatively high RTL levels indicate that kidneys do not meet the required performance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Normal Creatinine Levels by Age</h2>



<p>Average creatinine clearance may also differ depending on age, sex, muscle bulk, and level of health. Here is a Normal Creatinine Levels by age:</p>



<p><strong>Children</strong>: Typically between 0. 2 and 0. 7 mg/dL. If this is the case, levels would be slightly different depending on the child’s age and muscular development.</p>



<p><strong>Adult Women</strong>: On average, ranging from 0. 5 and 1. 1 mg/dL. Due to the physiologic differences, women usually have lesser muscle bulk than men, contributing to lower creatinine levels.</p>



<p><strong>Adult Men</strong>: Generally, it is not more than 0. 6 and 1. 2 mg/dL. This is usually traced to the fact that, on average, men have higher muscle mass. Thus, their creatinine level will be slightly higher, too.</p>



<p><strong>Elderly Individuals</strong>: Results Creatinine levels are slightly higher than expected mainly due to reduced muscle mass and aging effect on kidney function.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of High Creatinine Level</h2>



<p>Some cases may bother the patient, but they are not related to high creatinine levels but other illnesses the patient might be having; the following are some symptoms of Creatinine Level High that may appear:</p>



<p><strong>Fatigue and Weakness</strong>: If one has aches and pains, then one may have a kidney disease, or if he or she feels weak and tired.</p>



<p><strong>Swelling (Edema):</strong> Bloating, particularly of the hands, feet, or legs is the general sign of poor kidneys.</p>



<p><strong>Changes in Urine Output</strong>: Reduction of the number of urinations per day or changes in the color, consistency, or odor of urine.</p>



<p><strong>Nausea and Vomiting</strong>: It is also worthwhile to point out that some kinds of digestive disturbances may also be manifested during the progression of moderate renal dysfunction.</p>



<p><strong>Shortness of Breath</strong>: This is termed pulmonary edema which means increased fluid content in the lungs which may lead to breathing difficulties.</p>



<p><strong>Confusion or Difficulty Concentrating: </strong>Dementia may also present due to the accumulation of toxins in the body abnormalities may culminate in impairment of higher mental function.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Causes of Creatinine Level High</h2>



<p>Factors that cause high creatinine levels include:</p>



<p><strong>Kidney-related Disease</strong>: Kidney diseases are like chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury which raise the creatinine levels in the body.</p>



<p><strong>Dehydration</strong>: They also noted that if people consume small quantities of water in a day, then the creatinine will be higher because less blood flows to the kidneys.</p>



<p><strong>Muscle Breakdown</strong>: Other factors that can raise creatinine levels include diseases like rhabdomyolysis, where muscle tissue is rapidly broken down.</p>



<p><strong>Obstructions</strong>: Problems which include kidney stones and enlarged prostate glands, affect the working functions of the kidneys.</p>



<p><strong>Medications</strong>: The following drugs are known to have adverse effects on the kidneys: NSAIDs, certain antibiotic drugs, and fenprostalol.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment of High Creatinine Level</h2>



<p>Treatment of Creatinine Level High involves the management of its cause and kidney care if the kidneys cause the high production of creatinine. Approaches include:</p>



<p><strong>Hydration</strong>: Yes, if a person is dehydrated, then there is a chance that high levels of creatinine are due to it, and in that case, merely by increasing fluid intake, the situation can be handled.</p>



<p><strong>Medication Adjustment</strong>: Ensure the change of medicines likely to affect the kidney is checked and altered accordingly if necessary.</p>



<p><strong>Dietary modifications:</strong> Decreasing the protein intake per day and not using salt or limiting the intake of salt can also bring less stress to the kidneys.</p>



<p><strong>Managing some Conditions</strong>: One should know various ways to protect from new cases of such diseases as diabetes and hypertension so that the kidneys of a patient can be saved.</p>



<p><strong>Dialysis</strong>: Sometimes when the kidneys are impaired in their functioning the patient will need to undergo dialysis to clear wastes in the body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Is Precision Path Lab the Best Choice for Diagnosis?</h2>



<p>Precision Path Lab focuses on properly diagnosing the function of kidneys as safely as possible. Precision Path Lab uses technology and the help of experts with novel analysis, which makes it possible to obtain accurate measurements of creatinine levels and timely diagnoses. This indicates their dedication to delivering quality healthcare, especially renal examinations and treatments. Therefore, Precision Path Lab is the <a href="https://precisionpathlab.com/">Best Diagnostic Centre in Jaipur</a>.</p>



<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>



<p><strong>Why and how does creatinine level rise in the blood?</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>Creatinine levels that are higher than average suggest a person’s kidneys are not working correctly. There are several categories of CRP: Chronic Kidney Disease CKD, acute Kidney Injury AKI, Dehydration or Obstruction.</p>



<p><strong>Is there anything as a creatinine level spike?</strong></p>



<p>It may increase in creatinine in the short term because of acute kidney injury, severe dehydration, and rapid muscle breakdown, among others. This actually fix a visit to the doctor so that the actual cause of the problem may be determined.</p>



<p><strong>Given creatinine, what degree is it dangerous?</strong></p>



<p>Therefore, when creatinine levels increase and go beyond the standard limit (usually 1. 2 mg/dL in adults), it is dangerous. Any rise, which is a statistical change or an acute change, often needs further probing to establish the cause of the change.</p>



<p><strong>What are the best ways to reduce creatinine levels in the body?</strong></p>



<p>The measures to intervene more frequently to reduce high creatinine levels may involve enhancing the consumers’ water intake and avoiding the medications that impact the kidneys. One should always seek advice and treatment from the healthcare provider or the doctor every time.</p>

<p>White blood cells, normally known as leukocytes, are a very important component of the human immune system due to their role in fighting infections and diseases. WBC is very fundamental to any person&#8217;s health since it usually forms the basis for determining general health. If you are here due to a concern about low WBC levels, you might wonder how one may increase white blood cells. Usually, individuals have concerns about ways to increase white blood cells, and this guide is designed to address these questions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is WBC Count?</h2>



<p>White blood cells are important elements of the human body&#8217;s immune system, the main task of which is to detect pathogens and fight against them. WBCs are one of the components of blood, and there are many types of them. A WBC count is the number of such cells in the bloodstream and may reveal the state of health. Understanding how to improve WBC count naturally can be beneficial for boosting the immune system and over all well being.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of Low White Blood Cells</h2>



<p>A low White blood cell count is well known as leukopenia, and such a condition is not very good as it will take some time for the body to recover, and you are likely to be infected. Symptoms may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> Frequent infections</li>



<li> Fever</li>



<li> Fatigue</li>



<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>



<li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
</ul>



<p>If you experience any symptoms of low white blood cell count, it’s important to consult a doctor immediately and get all necessary tests from a reliable diagnostic cente.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types and Functions of White Blood Cells</h2>



<p>There are several types of white blood cells, each with unique functions:</p>



<p>The first defensive layer is composed of neutrophils, which are the most frequent type of white blood cells.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lymphocytes:</strong> These are T-cells and B-cells. The former has to be involved in the adaptive immune response if the latter is to take place.<br> </li>



<li><strong>Monocytes:</strong> They later develop into&#8217;macrophages&#8217;, ‘macrophages’ that is a cell that has specialized in trapping and destruction of pathogens within the body.<br></li>



<li><strong>Eosinophils:</strong> Act in the process of managing parasitic diseases and are involved in allergic diseases in the body.<br></li>



<li><strong>Basophils:</strong> these are cells that discharge granules containing histamine and other chemicals that play a role in regulating the allergic response.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Seven Methods to Increase your WBC count</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Improve Your Diet</h3>



<p>Taking foods with vitamins and minerals can improve white blood cell count. This is due to the rich content of carrots, where vitamin A is found, and ,oranges, which contain vitamin C and B12 which are found in meats and dairy products.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stay Hydrated</h3>



<p>Principles of medical jurisprudence suggest that the body should maintain enough water supply for the optimum blood volume required to execute all functions, including the synthesis of licensed white blood cells count.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exercise Regularly</h3>



<p>Exercise is always good and exceptionally moderate because it may enhance blood flow and increase white blood cell production. Having aerobic physical activity for at least 150 minutes of medium intensity every week works well for the body.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Get Adequate Sleep </h3>



<p>Good, sound sleep also plays an important role in building up a healthy and strong immune system in the body. Being a weekly paper, WBC takes about 7-9 hours to produce. The same applies to everyone who should sleep for 7-9 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reduce Stress </h3>



<p>Looking at various aspects of stress, it can be concluded that chronic stress impairs the immune system. Others include awareness and other exercises, including meditation, relaxation techniques, deep breathing, and even yoga.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol </h3>



<p>Smoking and taking alcohol frequently are other factors that are associated with low white blood cells counts. Cutting out these habits is understood to improve an individual’s immune system. Thus, the decline that is apparent to the outside world can be ameliorated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Consult Your Healthcare Provide </h3>



<p>It can at times be produced by some diseases or by employing some medication and drugs. An ideal piece of advice would be to approach your doctor and explain the situation to him so that he or she can recommend the right steps or treatments that will help<strong> </strong>increase white blood count levels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the Expected Normal Range of WBC Count?</h2>



<p>The expected range is of 4,000-11,000 cells per microliter of blood in the body. This range is the typical value for measuring your immune system&#8217;s condition. However, one should point out that this range is not fixed and may slightly differ from lab to lab, as well as in terms of age, sex, and the state of an individual&#8217;s health. For instance, children and pregnant women can have an average reference level that is different from others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the Tests for WBC?</h2>



<p>A healthcare provider can easily perform the test because the WBC count is a primary determinant of the complete blood count (CBC). This comprehensive <a href="https://precisionpathlab.com/cbc-test-price-in-jaipur.php"><strong>CBC Test</strong></a> measures several components of your blood including  :</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Total WBC Count:</strong> This shows the total count of white blood cells count per importer of blood in the body.</li>



<li><strong>Differential WBC Count:</strong> This divides the total WBC count into various groupings to show the effectiveness of the particular immunity; this includes neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.</li>



<li><strong>White Blood Cell Morphology:</strong> This looks at the size, shape, and color of bordering WBCs, which can be used to determine some conditions.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Disorders Linked with WBC</h2>



<p>Several disorders can affect WBC counts, including:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leukemia</h3>



<p>Is a cancer of the white blood cells as well as that of the bone marrow. Given that it is a viral disease affecting mainly children, all the children within the group would have been infected by the disease before enrolling in the program, regardless of the type of vaccination that they had.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lupus </h3>



<p>A sickness brought about by a self-infection that involves the cells of the body has the potential to lead to low levels of white blood cells in the system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HIV/AIDS </h3>



<p>It is the sort of virus that operates on the immune system of the body and lessens the number of white blood cells in the body.</p>

<p>Dengue fever is a global emerging public-health challenge, more so in tropical and subtropical areas, basically where the Aedes mosquito is more widespread. There are four important types of the dengue virus: either DEN-1 or DEN-2, DEN-3, or DEN-4. As the WHO estimated, 390 million people get infected annually, and 96 million develop clinical manifestations of the disease.</p>



<p>Thus, apart from the health effects, dengue results in significant economic burdens from illness costs and lost opportunities in the regions affected. common symptoms of dengue fever such as sudden high fever, severe headache, severe pain in joint and muscle.This shows that there is still a high prevalence of cases, especially for dengue. This calls for developing more proactive measures, enhanced screening, and better treatment measures to contain diseases&#8217; affectation on the population&#8217;s health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Dengue fever?</h2>



<p>Dengue fever is a disease that forms from sub, clinical, or stones such as dengue fever. It is an acute febrile illness shows some early signs of dengue like fever, headache, severe muscle and joint pains, rash, and rarely, bleeding diathesis and fulminant hepatitis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Early 7 Warning Signs of Dengue Fever</h2>



<p>Recognizing the early signs and symptoms of the dengue virus is crucial. Doctors recommend getting a <a href="https://precisionpathlab.com/full-body-check-up-in-jaipur.php"><strong>full body checkup</strong></a> at a trusted diagnostic center in our city if you experience any fever symptoms. Let&#8217;s understand some of the key warning signs and symptoms of dengue fever to be aware of:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sudden High Fever&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Individuals suffering from the flu-like viral disease called dengue fever are known to show the following dengue fever with warning signs, one of the earliest being fever that often rises and peaks at 104°F (40°C). The fever is generally abrupt and ranges from 2-7 days.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Severe Headache</h3>



<p>Severe headache, described as pulsating pain within the orbit of the eyes or on the forehead, is noticeable in most dengue fever patients. The latter type can be chronic, and sometimes it occurs significantly painful.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pain Behind the Eyes&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Flu-like illness can cause considerably painful throbbing along the course of the optic nerve when one moves the eyes. This symptom is known as retro-orbital pain and is specific to dengue fever, as indicated in this report.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Severe pain in Joint and Muscle&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Another distinct characteristic of dengue fever is acute joint and severe muscle pain, and thus, the people in some countries name this sickness as &#8220;breakbone fever&#8221;. Pain is mostly widespread and might render a patient incapacitated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fatigue&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Patients develop extreme fatigue and muscular weakness that may take several weeks to get back to normal, even after the acute phase of dengue fever is over. This kind of weakness extends to the point where daily activities and routines are affected.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nausea and Vomiting Problem&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Mostly the patients who are suffering from dengue fever have to face a severe problem regarding vomit, nausea, and loss of appetite during the time of dengue fever. Some gastrointestinal manifestations lead to a dehydrating process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Skin Rash&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Skin rashes may occur between days 2-5 of dengue fever in some cases. The rash tends to be maculopapular, red, and raised spots, which may be diffuse or localised over specific body parts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can Dengue Fever be Diagnosed?</h2>



<p>Diagnosis of dengue fever is first by clinical examination, second by the analysis of the patient&#8217;s history, and then by laboratory tests. Many health care providers would diagnose based on what are the first signs of dengue of the patient, travel history in areas prone to dengue disease, and findings of the clinical examination.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Laboratory Tests for Dengue Fever Diagnosis are Including like&nbsp;</em></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)&nbsp;</h4>



<p>PCR is the molecular biology technique that can identify the virus&#8217; genetic make up within the blood samples and is highly accurate, especially when taken in the early stages of dengue fever with warning signs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">NS1 Antigen&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Test establishes the existence of dengue virus NS1 antigen, which remains apparent most especially in the first 3-5 days of the disease.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Antibody Tests (IgM and IgG)</h4>



<p>Serological tests reflect the amounts of dengue-specific antibodies, namely IgM and IgG, produced by the immune system when infected by the dengue fever virus. IgM antibodies are made in the early symptoms of dengue fever infection, while IgG antibodies are produced later or from a previous infection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can Dengue Fever be Prevented?</h2>



<p>The prevention of dengue fever focuses on avoiding mosquito bites and current spreading and proper suppression of mosquitoes in the areas where dengue fever occurs. Here are effective preventive measures:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Mosquito Repellents:</strong> Apply protective lotions with DEET on body, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus also because they are very active ingredients which are good for protection.</li>



<li><strong>Protective Clothing:</strong> Some of the measures for protective clothing can include long-sleeved garments, trousers, socks, and closed shoes like clothes which protects from mosquitos.</li>



<li><strong>Eliminate Mosquito Breeding Sites:</strong> Do not let water to store for many days, because it further causes breeding sites for mosquitos.</li>



<li><strong>Sleeping under mosquito nets</strong>: This applies particularly if the premise is in a region with higher mosquito populations and during the night when one is asleep.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Liver function tests have a significant role in checking how properly the liver functions. The two leading critical indicators of liver tests are SGPT(ALT) and SGOT(AST). The doctors figure out any damage in the liver with the help of these tests. The SGPT and SGOT levels increase in the blood when the liver is injured or is not working correctly. This article will help to understand these tests&#8217; importance, their normal range, and what to do if the results are abnormal. Understanding SGPT and SGOT will help doctors and suggest better care for overall health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding SGPT and SGOT</h2>



<p>SGPT (also known as ALT) and SGOT (also known as AST) are enzymes mainly found in liver cells. These enzymes have primary roles in the metabolism of amino acids, known as building blocks of proteins. Typically, SGPT and SGOT are present in liver cells, but they are not usually found in considerable amounts in the bloodstream inside our body.<br>When liver cells are damaged or inflamed, SGPT and SGOT can be released into the bloodstream, causing their levels to rise. This leakage usually occurs because the outer membrane of liver cells becomes more permeable or damaged, allowing these enzymes to combine in the blood circulation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">SGPT (ALT)</h3>



<p>Function: SGPT (Alanine Aminotransferase or ALT) is mainly involved in transferring the amino group from alanine (an amino acid) to alpha-ketoglutarate, producing pyruvate and glutamate. This reaction is significant for energy production in cells of the body.<br>Specificity: SGPT plays a more significant role in the liver than SGOT. It is primarily found in the liver, and its levels in the blood are the best indicator to determine liver health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">SGOT (AST)</h3>



<p>Function: SGOT (Aspartate Aminotransferase or AST) catalyzes the shift of an amino group from aspartate to alpha-ketoglutarate, producing oxaloacetate and glutamate. This enzyme is essential for amino acid metabolism and the urea cycle in the body.<br>Distribution: SGOT is not only present in the liver but also in other organs such as the heart, muscles, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells in the body. Therefore, elevated SGOT levels can indicate damage or disease in these organs and the liver, making it more useful for overall health determination.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of High SGPT and SGOT Levels</h2>



<p>A spike in the level of SGPT and SGOT does not usually cause specific symptoms. But, the indication of underlying liver disease or liver damage happens, which may be known by the symptoms like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Feeling Tired: The patient might always feel tired, even after resting.</li>



<li>Yellow Skin and Eyes: Patient skin or the white part of the eyes might turn yellow (jaundice). Pee might also get darker, and stools lighter.</li>



<li>Pain in Your Belly: The patient might feel pain or discomfort on the upper right side of the belly where the liver is present.</li>



<li>Swelling: Belly or legs might swell up because of fluid buildup.</li>



<li>Feeling Sick: The patient could feel nauseous or vomit and dislike eating.</li>



<li>Losing Weight: Undesirable weight loss happens.</li>



<li>Easy Bruising or Bleeding: The patient might bruise easily or have bleeding gums or nosebleeds.</li>



<li>Itchy Skin: Skin might feel itchy, especially on hands and feet.</li>



<li>Spider-Like Blood Vessels: Patients might see tiny blood vessels on the skin.</li>
</ul>



<p>Don&#8217;t ignore symptoms of high SGPT and SGOT levels. It&#8217;s essential to get a <strong><a href="https://precisionpathlab.com/full-body-check-up-in-jaipur.php" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://precisionpathlab.com/full-body-check-up-in-jaipur.php" rel="noreferrer noopener">full body checkup</a></strong> in a year to catch any issues early and prevent them from worsening. Your health depends on regular monitoring and timely intervention.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are SGPT and SGOT Levels Only Indicators of Liver Disease?</h2>



<p>SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) are essential for checking liver health, but they do not always mean just liver problems. SGOT can also come from other parts like the heart and muscles, not only the liver. High SGOT levels might not always show a liver issue. Doctors use more tests, like scans and sometimes taking a small piece of liver tissue, to be sure about what is causing the problem. This helps them find the proper treatment. Keeping an eye on SGPT and SGOT levels is vital for liver health, but doctors look at the whole body to understand what is happening and how to help.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Normal Ranges for AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT)</h2>



<p>SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) are enzymes found in the liver, measured by a blood test to evaluate if the liver is working. Normal SGPT levels are usually between 7 to 56 units per litre of blood, and SGOT levels are typically between 8 to 40 units per litre. Normal levels mean the liver is healthy and doing its job very well. Doctors use these tests to keep an eye on liver health, especially if patients drink alcohol a lot, are overweight, or have hepatitis. If SGPT and SGOT levels are higher than usual, it might mean the liver is damaged or has a liver disease like hepatitis or fatty liver. More tests may be needed to determine why levels are high and what treatment might be required. Regular tests help monitor liver health and ensure any problems are caught early.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Critical levels of SGPT and SGOT</h3>



<p>It is considered critical when SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) levels get very high. For SGPT, this means it is more than ten times the standard upper limit, and SGOT is over 20 times that limit. These high levels show severe damage to the liver or other organs and need urgent medical attention. It could be due to problems like acute hepatitis, liver failure, or medication side effects harming the liver.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Interpreting Abnormal Test Results</h3>



<p>When SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) levels are not typical, they often indicate potential health issues. High SGPT and SGOT levels usually indicate liver damage from conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or excessive alcohol consumption. Sometimes, medications, muscle injuries, or heart problems can also affect these levels, especially SGOT. Doctors may add some tests such as blood work, scans, or a liver biopsy to determine the exact problem. Treatment depends on the diagnosis and includes medications, dietary adjustments, or managing other health conditions. Regular monitoring of SGPT and SGOT levels helps doctors assess treatment effectiveness and monitor overall liver health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Implications of Elevated SGPT and SGOT Levels</h3>



<p>When SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) levels are high, it often means there is potential damage to the liver. Causes can include hepatitis viruses, fatty liver disease due to being overweight, or excessive alcohol use. High levels suggest that liver cells might be injured or swollen. Doctors will do more tests to determine why levels are high, such as checking for infections or doing liver scans. Treatment depends on what is causing the high levels and may involve medicines, dietary changes, or managing conditions like diabetes. Treating liver problems early is essential to prevent serious issues like liver scarring or failure. Regular tests to check SGPT and SGOT levels help doctors monitor liver health and find problems early.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Procedure for the SGPT/SGOT Blood Test</h3>



<p>The blood test for SGPT/SGOT is also known as the liver function or liver enzyme test. The process involves several processes as below:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Blood Draw: A nurse or doctor will tie a band around the arm to find a vein. They will clean the area and insert a small needle to draw blood into a tube.</li>



<li>Collection of Sample: The blood is collected into a unique tube and labeled with the patient&#8217;s name. It is sent to a lab for testing, Precision Path also provides their patient with the facility of <strong><a href="https://precisionpathlab.com/home-collection.php" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://precisionpathlab.com/home-collection.php" rel="noreferrer noopener">home sample collection</a></strong> from any area of Jaipur.</li>



<li>Lab Analysis: In the lab, technicians measure the levels of SGPT and SGOT in blood to see if they are within normal ranges.</li>



<li>Results: The doctor will get and discuss the results with the patient. They will explain what the levels mean for liver health.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing for SGPT/SGOT Blood Tests</h3>



<p>Fasting is not typically required to prepare for the SGPT/SGOT blood test. However, it is essential to make sure that your healthcare provider is aware of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking, as some of the substances may impact liver enzyme levels. Avoiding alcohol before a certain period of test is recommended by the doctors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk Associated with the SGPT/SGOT Blood Test</h3>



<p>SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) blood tests are safe but have risks. They may cause discomfort or bruising at the needle site. Some people feel faint or dizzy during or after. Infection at the needle spot is rare but possible. Excessive bleeding is rare, too, especially for those with bleeding issues or on certain meds. Exercise or medications can affect results. These tests are vital for liver health checks and disease detection despite risks. If any concerns arise, talk to a doctor promptly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cost of the SGPT-SGOT blood test in India</h2>



<p>The cost of SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) blood tests can vary. In India, at private clinics or labs, they can cost from a few hundred to over a thousand rupees. Depending on their policies, government hospitals may offer them at lower costs or for free. These tests are often part of routine check-ups and might be covered by health insurance. It is essential to check with the healthcare provider or facility to determine the exact cost and if insurance covers it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion </h2>



<p>In summary, SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) levels are crucial for assessing liver health. When these levels are high, it signals potential liver issues like damage or disease. Doctors may perform additional tests to identify the exact problem. It is essential to be prepared for these tests and understand what affects their results.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Urine color holds valuable hints about our health, which reflects many factors like hydration levels, diet, medications, and other health conditions. Some changes in the color of urine may be a signal of health issues. The doctor refers to the standard color of urine as ‘urochrome’ which carries yellow pigment. For a well-hydrated body, urine color is light yellow. A dehydrated body turns urine color from light yellow to light brown, which may be a sign of liver disease. Clear urine color indicates an excess of drinking water. Sometimes it may be the result of a urine tract infection, which makes urine smell unusual, cloudiness, brown color, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is the Urine Color Chart?</h2>



<p>The NHS gives a urine color chart to determine how hydrated our body is. The various colors of urine shown in this chart, like pale yellow, brown, pink, murky, honey, transparent, dark yellow, red, etc., indicate different symptoms of unhealthiness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are the Causes of Changes in Urine Color?</h2>



<p>The changes observed in pee color show our body-related problems, which is due to dehydration, pigmented food, excess exercise, or any infections, and may be due to some diseases like Porphyria, Jaundice, Bilirubin, Hematuria, etc. Some major causes for changes in urine color are listed as below:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dehydration</h3>



<p>It occurs when a body loses more fluids than it takes in, which leads to an imbalance of electrolytes in our body and results to impairing of normal bodily function. Dehydration directly affects the concentration and color of urine, and urine output amount, and creates the risk of kidney stones, rapid heartbeat, headache, etc. The proper need for water should be fulfilled in our body for hydration from time to time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Diet</h3>



<p>The role of diet in urine color is significant, both foods and beverages can affect its color. Some pigmented foods like blackberries, beetroot, carrot, rhubarb, etc. cause different colors of pee, but these are generally harmless. Vitamins like vitamin B2 turn pee to a yellow color. Drinks like alcohol and caffeine increase urine production and make it lighter in color.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Medications</h3>



<p>Certain medicines like Tagamet, phenazopyridine, etc. cause changes in the color of urine. Some medical conditions like kidney stones, liver problems, diabetes, metabolic disorders, cancer, etc. also influence urine color. Not only in color but some symptoms like painful urination, peeing more often, etc. are observed due to the effects of medicines on our body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Detailed Breakdown of Urine Color Chart</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Clear or Transparent</h3>



<p>Urine color is turned into clear or transparent like water due to ‘excess of water intake and minimal waste products present in urine’ in our body. Clear color is usually a positive sign of hydration, but it&#8217;s essential to maintain a balance and not overhydrate, which can also have potential health risks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pale Yellow</h3>



<p>Pale yellow is typically considered a sign of good ‘hydration and overall health’ in our body. This color shows adequate hydration, a balanced diet, effective functioning of kidneys, and efficient intake of vitamins and nutrients. Sometimes yellow color of urine is because of the rich B vitamins in the body.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Transparent Yellow</h3>



<p>A change in the transparent yellow color of urine is a sign of ‘optimal hydration’ which indicates that the body&#8217;s intake of fluids is more than its need for basic function. This change is not harmful to the body. It can be the result of consuming food or drinks with natural diuretic properties, such as alcohol and it may be due to climate change, medication, and individual variations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dark Yellow</h3>



<p>A dark yellow color indicates ‘moderate dehydration’ in our body. It shows that the need for water is more than the intake in our body for functioning well. It may be the result of environmental factors like hot weather, high altitudes, and intense physical activity, which turns urine color to dark yellow. To cure this a normal need of ‘8 glasses of water’ should be fulfilled to make the body properly hydrated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Amber or Honey</h3>



<p>The urine color of honey gives hints about ’moderate to severe dehydration’ in our body. It can be caused by loses of more fluid through sweating, breathing, and urination in our body than intake water. With honey urine color some other factors like extreme thirst, fatigue, dizziness, and decreased urine output are observed in the body. It may be due to liver diseases, kidney stones, and urinary tract infections.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dark Yellow or Orange</h3>



<p>The dark yellow or orange color of urine is sign of ‘dehydration to underlying health conditions’ in our body. Many factors are affecting pee color to orange like medication, dehydration, liver conditions, bile duct obstruction, urinary tract infections, hematuria, metabolic disorder, supplements of vitamins B etc. Sometimes it is result of certain food like carrots, beets, artificial food dyes etc. This change should be noticed and consulted to doctor before more severe problem in body.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pink or Red</h3>



<p>The pink or red color in urine can be alarming and should be investigated promptly. It can be caused by factors like blood in urine, medications (antibiotics or senna), beets or blackberries, menstruation in women, porphyria, kidney stones, injury, enlarged prostate, glomerulonephritis, cancer, and strenuous exercise. The effects of this change should be treated at the right time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blue or Green</h3>



<p>Blue or green color in urine is less common than pink or red, but it can still be a cause for concern. Some reasons for this color are like food or medical tests dyes, bilirubin, genetic disorder, pseudomonas infection, methyl blue poisoning, altered Ph level, and due to supplements like vitamin B2. It is harmless and temporary but need to be proper evaluation and diagnosis. However, other symptoms are also detected with it like pain, fever, or change in urinary habits.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dark Brown</h3>



<p>The dark brown color in urine indicates various health issues. Caused factors are dehydration, liver disorder, bile duct obstruction, hematuria, Rhabdomyolysis, Hemolytic Anemia, infection diseases, Alkaptonuria, toxic injection, kidney stones, and Autoimmune disorders. Depending upon the suspected underlying cause, further testing, including urine analysis, blood tests, or other diagnostic procedures.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cloudy or Murky</h3>



<p>Cloudy or murky urine may also indicate the presence of protein, blood, or pus in the urine, which could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition such as kidney disease, urinary tract infections, or bladder infections. It is important to pay attention to any accompanying symptoms like pain, burning, sensation during urination, fever, or frequent urination, and seek medical attention promptly if you experience any concerning changes in your urine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to Seek Medical Advice</h2>



<p>Changes in urine color can sometimes be a sign of many health issues, it is generally a good idea to get your test done from a path lab if any changes in urine color are observed. Some major changes are listed below:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
