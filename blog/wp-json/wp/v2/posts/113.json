Viral fevers, caused by various infectious agents such as viruses, often present with symptoms that can be challenging to differentiate from other illnesses. In this context, blood tests play a crucial role in providing precise and timely diagnoses. By analyzing specific markers in the blood, healthcare professionals can not only confirm the presence of a viral infection but also gain valuable insights into its severity and progression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we will talk about the symptoms of viral fever, why blood tests are so crucial, and what they can tell us. You\u2019ll learn about the fever panel, which is like a backbone of tests to figure out what&#8217;s going on, from simple ones like checking your blood cells to more specific markers for your organs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>What Are the Symptoms Of Viral Fever?<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Symptoms of viral fever can vary from person to person but if you&#8217;re experiencing a combination of these, it might be viral fever &amp; you must go for a viral fever blood test for the right treatment. Here are common symptoms of viral fever:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>High body temperature<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chills and sweating<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Headache<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Body aches<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fatigue<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sore throat<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cough<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role of Blood Test Report for Viral Fever<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blood tests play a significant role in diagnosing viral fever. They provide a detailed analysis of various components of the blood, which can help identify the cause of the fever. This tests not only help identify the problem but also tell us how severe it is. Blood tests also play an ongoing role in monitoring your progress, helping doctors check the effectiveness of treatments and make necessary adjustments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s get to know some common type of blood tests for fever diagnosis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Complete Blood Count (CBC)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/precisionpathlab.com\/cbc-test-price-in-jaipur.php\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/precisionpathlab.com\/cbc-test-price-in-jaipur.php\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Complete Blood Count<\/a> (CBC)<\/strong>\u00a0is a broad screening test that examine three important aspects of your body to understand if there&#8217;s a germ invasion, any trouble stopping bleeding, or a need for more oxygen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This test looks at three crucial things in your blood \u2013the number of white blood cells, the number of red blood cells, and platelets in your blood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">White blood cell count (WBC)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>White Blood Cell Count (WBC): These are like the defenders in your body. If there&#8217;s an infection or inflammation, they increase to fight it off. A high WBC count may indicate the presence of an infection or inflammation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Platelet count<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Platelets, small blood cells that help the body form clots to stop bleeding, typically range from 150,000 to 450,000 per microliter of blood. A count too low or too high can indicate a medical condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hemoglobin levels<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your body\u2019s organs and tissues. It should be 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter for men and 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter for women. Low hemoglobin levels might be a sign of anemia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Inflammatory Markers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Inflammatory markers are like built-in alert systems within your bloodstream, providing silent signals when your body encounters inflammation or infection. This helps in recognizing inflammation early in the context of viral fever. These markers act as informative clues, guiding doctors to decipher your body&#8217;s response. We have the two main test in the group: C-reactive protein (CRP) &amp; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">C-reactive protein (CRP)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>CRP is produced by the liver. When there&#8217;s inflammation in the body, your liver produces CRP, and its levels increase. It&#8217;s like a red flag saying, &#8220;Hey, something&#8217;s not right here!&#8221; Increased CRP levels help doctors spot areas of inflammation in the body &amp; help them do the right treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This test, measure how red blood cells settle in a tube. If they settle too fast, it could signal a broader issue like inflammation or infection in your body. It&#8217;s like your blood is sending a message that something might be off. While ESR doesn&#8217;t pinpoint the exact cause, it&#8217;s a helpful clue for doctor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Organ-Specific Markers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Organ-Specific Markers are like superheroes focusing on specific organs to make sure everything is A-okay. We have two main tests in this group: Liver Function Tests (LFTs) and Cardiac Enzymes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Liver function tests (LFTs)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>These tests measure the levels of certain enzymes and proteins in your blood. Variations from the normal range can indicate liver disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>These enzymes act like emergency beacons released into the bloodstream when your heart muscle is under stress, often due to a heart attack. These markers help doctors decipher if there&#8217;s been any heart-related distress, guiding them to understand and respond to potential cardiac issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Malaria and Dengue<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When a patient exhibits symptoms akin to malaria or dengue fever, specific tests come into play, acting as diagnostic superheroes. These tests serve a crucial role in either confirming or ruling out the presence of these diseases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Malaria Testing<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p> If a person suffers from symptoms like fever, chills, and body aches, malaria tests detect the presence of the malaria parasite in the blood. This test serves as the definitive tool for healthcare professionals to conclusively confirm the presence of malaria in the person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dengue Testing<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If a person suffers from symptoms like severe headache, joint pain, and rash, dengue tests identify the presence of dengue virus antibodies or the virus itself. This test acts as the ultimate tool for healthcare professionals, providing a clear and definitive confirmation of the presence of dengue in the individual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know more about &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/precisionpathlab.com\/blog\/how-to-read-a-blood-test-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/precisionpathlab.com\/blog\/how-to-read-a-blood-test-report\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to R\u0435ad a Blood T\u0435st R\u0435port<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>How To Get a Fever Panel Done at Home in Jaipur?<\/strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>If you find yourself in Jaipur and are in need of a comprehensive fever panel without the hassle of leaving your home, Precision Pathlab offers a convenient solution.
