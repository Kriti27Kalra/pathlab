It&#8217;s a protein in your red blood cells (RBCs) that carries oxygen from your lungs to all the cells in your body. You can also compare hemoglobin with a delivery person. The way a delivery person picks up your order from the outlet and delivers it to you at your place. Similarly, hemoglobin picks up oxygen from your lungs and delivers it to every part of your body so that your cells can use it to do their jobs properly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, without enough hemoglobin, your cells won&#8217;t get the oxygen they need, which can make you feel tired, weak, and can cause other health problems. This is why hemoglobin is super important for keeping your body running smoothly and healthy! So, are you eager to know how to increase hemoglobin levels? Then, you are at the correct website. In this blog, we will focus on all the important sections related to hemoglobin. Thus, let&#8217;s get started and first understand how hemoglobin works in our body.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does Hemoglobin in Our Body Work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The step-by-step process for the working of a hemoglobin in our body is given below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Oxygen Intake<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, when we breathe in, oxygen enters the lungs and attaches to the iron atoms in the hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transportation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, hemoglobin acts as a carrier and transports oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to tissues, organs, and throughout the body via the circulatory system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Oxygen Release<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As red blood cells travel through the body&#8217;s blood vessels, they reach tissues and organs where oxygen is needed. Then, hemoglobin releases the oxygen molecules, allowing cells to use them for energy production through cellular respiration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Returning<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As cells use oxygen, they produce carbon dioxide as a waste product. In this process, hemoglobin also helps in picking up carbon dioxide and transporting it back to the lungs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exhaling Carbon Dioxide<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p> When you breathe out, you release carbon dioxide from your lungs, and the cycle starts again when you breathe in fresh oxygen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the continuous cycle, ensuring that oxygen is efficiently delivered to cells throughout the body while removing carbon dioxide from our body. This is why Hemoglobin&#8217;s role is crucial in binding and releasing oxygen for maintaining the body&#8217;s overall function and survival. But most people don&#8217;t know the reasons for low hemoglobin counts in their blood. The next section will give you the answers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are the Reasons for a Low Hemoglobin Count?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are uncountable reasons why the hemoglobin levels can dip in your body, which are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Inadequate intake of iron in your diet<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Suffering from chronic diseases like kidney problems or cancer<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Taking certain medications for so long, such as antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and antiretroviral drugs, can cause anaemia as a side effect.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>At the time of pregnancy, the body needs more blood, which lowers the hemoglobin count.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some genetic conditions, such as thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia, can also affect hemoglobin production or the structure of hemoglobin molecules.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Loss of blood at the time of menstruation or due to an injury<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many more reasons why someone might have a low hemoglobin count. This is why it\u2019s essential to determine the root cause of low hemoglobin through medical evaluation and testing to ensure appropriate treatment and management. Apart from that, having hemoglobin boosting foods can also help.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Much Hemoglobin Is Needed by an Adult Human?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The amounts of hemoglobin needed by an adult human are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Age Group<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Hemoglobin Levels (g\/dL)<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Adult Men<\/td><td>14-18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Adult Women Pregnant Women<\/td><td>12-16 Below 11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Older Ages<\/td><td>Can slightly decrease<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK259\/#:~:text=To%20ensure%20adequate%20tissue%20oxygenation,low%2C%20the%20patient%20has%20anemia.\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK259\/#:~:text=To%20ensure%20adequate%20tissue%20oxygenation,low%2C%20the%20patient%20has%20anemia.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NIH NLM<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These values might vary slightly from one laboratory to another due to the conduct of the tests and the specific reference ranges they use.
