Now to the question, are the heart rate and pulse are same? The short answer is: not entirely. Although monitoring pulse rate is almost equal to monitoring heart rate, especially for those who are in optimum health, there is a slight difference in their meaning and how they are measured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly people should learn more about their bodies with all the complications that come with it. Several signs are used to determine cardiovascular health and two of them are heart rate and pulse rate. Although they are often used interchangeably there are some slight differences between them. Here in the blog, let\u2019s delve into the difference between heart rate and pulse rate, how it could be measured, and what are the recommended ranges for a healthy heart rate and pulse rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Heart Rate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Heart rate is the number of contractions of the heart muscle per minute or simply beats per one minute. This is a measure of the heart directly, which gives valuable information about how effectively your heart and circulatory system is working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The human body has monitoring mechanisms that control the heartbeat enhancing flexibility depending on the activities and circumstances of the body. The heartbeat increases when a person is angry and decreases when the person is at rest. It is not safe for a person to go beyond 95% of the maximum heart rate level of excitement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the Normal Range of Heart Rate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A resting adult has a heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute and the number may be higher or lower depending on fitness level, age, and other conditions. Athletes and persons having extremely low levels of body fat usually record resting heart rate of less than 60 BPM or beats per minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let\u2019s consider the heart rate in relation to age, here are the most valuable pieces of information that will change your idea of \u200b\u200bthe heartbeat normal range which is not a dangerous heart rate at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>For infants it is approximately 70-190 bpm.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In children aged between 3 to 9 years, it is between 70 to 130 bpm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In teenagers, from the age of ten to twenty years, it ranges between 60 \u2013 100 beats per minute.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is higher with the above 20 years group but it stays almost constant without any fluctuation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a>What are the Methods of Measuring Heart Rate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Manual Palpation &#8211; Take the two fingers (index and middle) and place it on the side of the wrist or the neck. Take the beats for 15 seconds and then multiply that number by 4.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Heart Rate Monitors &#8211; Smart accessories such as smartwatches.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Electrocardiogram (ECG) &#8211; A medical test that can give an accurate readout of the heart\u2019s performance during an exam.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pulse Oximeter &#8211; Measures oxygen levels and pulse using sensors that are attached to fingertips.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a>What is Pulse Rate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pulse rate is defined as the count of the palpitation felt in a sixty seconds period. These pulses are actually caused by the regular throbbing motion of the arteries as a result of blood flow, beat of the heart. The pulse rate thus gives the heart rate most of the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a>What is the Normal Range of Pulse Rate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the heart rate, the pulse rate in adults ranges from 60 to 100 with the average being 72 beats per minute. However, stress, temperature, or any intense physical activity may cause the rate to increase or decrease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a>What are the Methods of Measuring Pulse Rate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Radial Pulse &#8211; Take the position where you put the fingers at the level of the wrist close to the base of the thumb.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Carotid Pulse &#8211; Position your hands on the side of the neck just below where your jaw line is.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Other Pulse Points &#8211; Pulse can also be present in regions such as the brachial, femoral, and dorsalis pedis arteries.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pulse Rate Monitors &#8211; Some specific devices to use include pulse oximeters or even fitness trackers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Heart Rate and Pulse Rate Difference<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The heart is one of the greatest wonders of nature; it beats away ceaselessly performing the function of circulation. Its rhythm is often measured using two terms: heartbeat vs pulse rate. These metrics provide information on the cardiovascular well-being of an individual. But are they the same? Well, if they are not the same, how are they different? Let\u2019s dive into the concept which distinguishes pulse rate from heart rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Aspect<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Heart rate<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Pulse rate<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Definition<\/td><td>Regularity of the heartbeat per minute.<\/td><td>Palpable number of heartbeats per minute.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Measurement location<\/td><td>Internal measurement, like through ECG.<\/td><td>Assessed in terms of external circulation, that is at pulse points.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Measurement tools<\/td><td>Smartwatches, fitness trackers, and electrocardiographs.<\/td><td>Pulse oximeters and manual palpation.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dependency<\/td><td>Independent of pulse rate.<\/td><td>Dependent on heart rate.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Accuracy<\/td><td>Information on cardiac activity as the total output or a single component can be obtained directly.<\/td><td>Indirect heart rate reflection.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Factors Affect Heart Rate and Pulse Rate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you are aware of pulse rate vs heart rate, here are some factors that influence both heart rate and pulse rate:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Physical Activity: These include that exercise raises the rate of the heartbeat and pulse. While rest time reduces them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Emotional State: Rates are likely to go high due to stress, anxiety, or excitement. They can be reduced with meditation, and being calm.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Health Conditions: The variations may be caused by fever, dehydration, or heart conditions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Age and Fitness Level: It is a fact that resting rates decrease with age and are lower in athletes in comparison to non-athletes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Medications: Some medications decrease the rate such as beta blockers while others can raise the rate such as Caffeine.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a>Tips for Maintaining Normal Heart Rate and Pulse Rate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep your heart rate and pulse rate within a healthy range, follow these tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Exercise Regularly: Do activities that are aerobic with little or no exertion; it includes walking, swimming, and cycling. Add strength activities into your fitness regime for enhanced health.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Practice Stress Management: Use stress minimizing methods such as doing yoga or meditating. If possible, reduce chronic stressors in your life.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eat a Heart-Healthy Diet: Supplements, particularly those containing Omega 3 fatty acids, whole grain foods and lean meats should form the basis of any diet. Reduce the daily intake of salt and sugar and saturated fats.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stay Hydrated: Water is important for hydration and its lack can put pressure on the heart so take a lot of water each day.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avoid Harmful Habits: Avoid consuming caffeine and alcohol bearing products. Stop smoking in order to enhance the status of your cardiovascular system.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get Regular Check-Ups: Special attention must be taken in checking heart rate from time to time at the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/precisionpathlab.com\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/precisionpathlab.com\/\">best diagnostic center<\/a><\/strong> to check for abnormalities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is some difference between pulse rate and heart rate, this is due to the differences in their definitions and in the manner in which they are measured as well as the kind of information they can give. Whereas the heart rate reveals the kind of work the heart is performing internally, the pulse rate displays the work the arteries are doing on account of the internal activity of the heart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge about these statistics is indispensable when it comes to keeping healthy and early identification of health problems.
